# Python Scripts and It's Performance
Test performance for some python scripts.

You can clone this code and run on your environment to check the performance.

# [Iterate List](iterate_list.py)
For example: double each elements and return a list.
```
[0, 1, 2, 3] -> [0, 2, 4, 6]
```

# [Iterate List with function](iterate_list_with_func.py)
For example: double each elements by function and return a list.
```
[0, 1, 2, 3] -> [0, 2, 4, 6] (by function)
```

# [Iterate List with IO](iterate_list_with_io.py)
For example: double each elements with sleeping x seconds and return a list.
```
[0, 1, 2, 3] -> [0, 2, 4, 6] (with sleep)
```

# [Manippulate List](manippulate_list.py)
Manipulate each elements in list in-place.

Test each scripts and exam which are available. For example: double each elements "in-place"
```
[0, 1, 2, 3] -> [0, 2, 4, 6] (in-place)
```

# [Flatten 2D list](flatten_2dlist.py)
Flatten 2D list to 1D list.
```
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
